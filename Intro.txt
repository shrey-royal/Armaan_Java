Introduction to Java:

> Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

> It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

> Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

> Java comes with it's own JVM which is platform independent.

Syntax:

public class Sample {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

Rules:

1. We can make multiple classes in one java file but only one class can be public.
2. The name of the file should be same as the name of the public class.
3. The main method should be public, static and void. 
4. The main method should have a string array as an argument.
5. There may be multiple main methods in a class but only one can be public.
6. The name of the class should be in camel case(CamelCase).
